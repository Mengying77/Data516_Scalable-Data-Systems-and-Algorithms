## Project Description - ML in Big Data

 

References papers about usages of SQL for ML tasks listed above:

## Approaches 
- Express basic and fundamental Machine Learning algorithm (e.g. linear regression, logistic regression, etc.) using a SQL/Spark query (
    - Define lambda function in SQL
    - Define UDF in Spark
- Run query on SQL and Spark, as well as using python, change data size, and record runtimes for comparison
